====
The topics in this document deal with app deployments through both the cloud-based and the on-premise versions of the Runtime Manager console. It also deals with deployments to both CloudHub and on-premise environments. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-runtime-manager[CloudHub and Runtime Manager] for a better understanding of the differences between both.
====




The Runtime Manager is the tool in the Anypoint Platform with which you deploy and manage your Mule applications.

After you've created a Mule application (be it through Anypoint Studio or outside), you can deploy it so that it runs either in CloudHub – our cloud ipaas platform – or on one of your own servers, server groups, or clusters.

It provides a dashboard that indicates the status of every deployed app and every monitored server, as well as a rich set of features that allow you to manage and track the running of your application.

[NOTE]
On Anypoint Studio, hitting the *Play* button deploys your application to a test server that is built into Studio, this server has limitations and is not meant for production deployments. Ultimately you will want to deploy your application to either CloudHub or a Mule Runtime instance running in a server, both of which are managed via the Runtime Manager.

==== Mule Flows



As an example, a CloudHub integration can monitor, or poll, your Salesforce instance for any changes across all of your accounts. When a change occurs, the integration converts the changed data to a CSV file, and then uploads the file to your on-premises SFTP site. The Mule flow would contain three Message Processors and look like this:

These flows are quickly assembled inside Mule Studio with just a few clicks and pieces of configuration. In just a few minutes you can have a complete working integration between your SaaS services and your on-premise systems.
