= Alerts and Notifications
:keywords: cloudhub, management, analytics, runtime manager, arm

[NOTE]
Alerts and Notifications are a feature that is currently only available for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. They are not available for applications that you deploy via the Runtime Manager to external servers on premises or in the cloud. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-runtime-manager[CloudHub and Runtime Manager] for more details.

== Overview

*Notifications* are standard messages that appear in the CloudHub console to provide status information about your applications. 

*Alerts* give you the ability to trigger emails whenever certain events related to your application occur.

CloudHub includes several out of the box *standard alert* types:

* You exceed a certain number of events processed in a certain time period.
* A deployment completes with success or failure.
* The secure data gateway gets connected or disconnected.
* CloudHub encounters a problem with the worker on an application via the worker monitoring system.

Creating a standard alert creates both a notification in the console and an alert action, such as email to a specific user.

CloudHub also lets you create your own *custom alerts* for your application. Custom alerts are triggered by notifications that your application sends to the CloudHub console (using the link:http://mulesoft.github.io/cloudhub-connector[CloudHub Connector]). For example, you can send a custom alert when:

* Your application is unable to connect to a remote service.
* An error occurs which requires human intervention, such as a problem with data mapping.
* You want to create a summary of what occurred inside your application, such as the number of orders processed.

Custom alerts differ from standard alerts in that you  receive a notification from your application inside the console UI regardless of whether you configure an alert.

== Managing Notifications

Notifications appear by clicking the bell icon in the top-right of the CloudHub console. When you have new notifications, the bell turns red.

Each notification has a priority level and a message associated with it. If the notification is associated with a specific application, the application name is also provided.
