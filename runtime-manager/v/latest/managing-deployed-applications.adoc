= Managing Deployed Applications
:keywords: cloudhub, managing, monitoring, deploy, runtime manager, arm

After you deploy an application through the Runtime Manager, you can use the console to monitor and manage it at runtime.

Depending on if your application is deployed to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[CloudHub] or to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-your-own-servers[your own servers], there is a different set of possible actions you can perform on it, once deployed.

This page introduces the basic management tools in the console that are common to both ways of deploying:

* Start, Stop, or Delete an Application

Updating Your Application
Downloading a Copy of Your Deployed Application






With applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-on-your-own-servers[your own servers] you can do the following:

* link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Managing Servers]
* link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[Sending Data from Runtime Manager to External Monitoring Software]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Create clusters and server groups]

With applications deployed to link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[CloudHub] you can manage the following:

* link:/runtime-manager/alerts-and-notifications[Notifications]
* link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-insight[Insight]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-queues[Queues]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-schedules[Schedules]
* link:/runtime-manager/secure-application-properties[Secure Application Properties]
* link:/runtime-manager/viewing-log-data[View application log data]
* link:/runtime-manager/worker-monitoring[Worker Monitoring]
* link:/runtime-manager/secure-data-gateway[Secure Data Gateway]
* link:/runtime-manager/managing-application-data-with-object-stores[Object Stores]

[TIP]
Before accessing the Runtime Manager Console, you must first link:/anypoint-platform-administration/creating-an-account[create an account]. After you have an account, you can log into the Anypoint Platform from the link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint PLatform login page].


== Getting Started

https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Log in to Anypoint Platform] and click *Runtime Manager*:

image:APStartScreen.png[APStartScreen]

The Runtime Manager has two main tabs, *Applications* and *Servers*.

=== Applications Tab

In the Runtime Manager, an application is a Mule Application that is running on a Mule runtime or an API Gateway runtime instance. The instance can be running in CloudHub, in an on-premise server of your organization, in a group of servers, or in a cluster. For server groups, an application deployed to the group runs on every server in the group.

=== Servers Tab

In the Runtime Manager, a server is a Mule or API Gateway instance in a location other than CloudHub and that you must first register in the Runtime Manager console. Once registered and configured in this tab, you may deploy your applications to it through the Applications Tab.

image:AMC_Servers.png[AMC_Servers]

From the *Servers* tab, by selecting an entry as shown, you can perform these tasks:

* Add a Serve (registers the server with the Anypoint Runtime Manager console)
* Start Mule or API Gateway
* Create a Server Group
* Add a Server to a Server Group
* Stop an Application on a Server
* Remove a Server from a Server Group
* Delete a Server
* Delete a Server Group

For more on the options offered by this tab, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Managing Servers].



== Application Tasks

From the *Applications* tab, by selecting an entry as shown, you can perform these tasks:

Topics:

* <<Deploy an Application>>
* <<Start, Stop, and Delete an Application>>
* <<Manage an Application>>


== Dashboard Overview

When you first log into the Anypoint Platform, click *CloudHub* from the top menu:

image:APStartScreen.png[APStartScreen]

You then see the *Applications* menu where you can get a quick view of the applications that are currently deployed and running for your account. Click an entry to display additional information (as shown below), or click *Manage Application* to see the CloudHub dashboard and the detailed page for the application:

image:AMC_ManageApplication.png[AMC_ManageApplication]

Creating an application is the first step to link:/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub[Deploying to CloudHub]. Each application must have a unique application domain. If you use the link:/runtime-manager/command-line-tools[Command Line Tools] or Anypoint Studio, you do not need to perform this step using the console. After you create at least one application, you can see your applications listed here, including the number of transactions and the percentage of CPU usage over the past hour.

You can use link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[Servers] in your organization to run applications that you manage with the Runtime Manager. In addition, you can create server groups and clusters to run an application and manage the server group from the Runtime Manager.

Next to each application name, you can see an icon that represents the current status of the application.  The meaning of the status icons is summarized below:

.Application Status
[width="100a",cols="10a,90a",options="header"]
|===
|Icon |Description
|image:console_overview_white_circle.png[console_overview_white_circle] |The application is not running.

|image:console_overview_blue_circle.png[console_overview_blue_circle] |The application is deploying.

|image:console_overview_green_circle.png[console_overview_green_circle] |The application is running.

|image:console_overview_red_circle.png[console_overview_red_circle] |The application deployment failed.

|image:console_overview_yellow_circle.png[console_overview_yellow_circle] |The application update failed.
|===

== Application Dashboard

Click an application to show its overview menu, and click *Manage Applications* from the overview. This opens the dashboard where you can select one of the following menu options on the left:















=== Deploy an Application

Deploy an application means that you want your application to run on CloudHub, or a server or server group in your organization. Use Anypoint Studio to create an application as described in link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World on CloudHub]. 

In the Applications screen, click *Deploy application*: 

image:AMC_DeployApp.png[AMC_DeployApp]

Specify:

* *Application Name* - An application name that consists of at least 3 characters in length with a maximum of 40 characters, containing only letters, numbers, or dashes, and cannot start with a dash.
+
* *Deployment Target* - From the drop-down list, click *CloudHub*, a server name, or a server group for where you want to deploy your application. CloudHub means you're deploying to the cloud, whereas a server or group means you're deploying an application to one or more servers in your organization's data center.
+
If you click *CloudHub*, also supply:
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Tab |Values
|*Runtime* |Runtime version, worker size, workers, region, and restart options
|*Properties* |Key value pairs
|*Insight* |link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-insight[CloudHub Insight] values for metadata and replay
|*Logging* |Log level and categories to include in logs
|===
+
* *Application File* - A zip file created by Anypoint Studio. To create the file in Studio, export your project from Studio as a zip file and import it into Anypoint Runtime Manager.

The bell icon in the upper right corner lets you manage notifications. For more information, see link:/runtime-manager/alerts-and-notifications[Managing Notifications] in the link:/runtime-manager/alerts-and-notifications[Alerts and Notifications] guide.

=== Start, Stop, or Delete an Application

To start, stop, or delete an application, click an application, and click the status down-arrow (the menus differ by Status):

image:AMC_StopStartDeleteApp.png[AMC_StopStartDeleteApp]

Click *Start*, *Stop*, or *Delete* as needed. The *Start* command restarts stopped applications, and if the application is Undeployed, sends the application's zip file to the server to start the application on the server.

[IMPORTANT]
After you delete an application, your log data is no longer accessible through the console. CloudHub archives old log data for a limited period of time before being purged. This allows you to recover the data if needed. mailto:cloudhub-support@mulesoft.com[Contact Support] for more information.


=== Manage an Application

Managing an application lets you view a dashboard that lists Mule Messages, CPU use, memory use, and any of the categories of commands in the left navigation area, such as viewing logs, alerts, queues, change settings, debugging, and more.

To manage an application, click *Manage Application*: 

image:AMC_ManageApplication.png[AMC_ManageApplication]

An example is (what displays may vary by permissions):
