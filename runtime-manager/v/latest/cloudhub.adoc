= CloudHub
:keywords: cloudhub, cloud, api, runtime manager, arm

Before getting started with CloudHub, it's important to understand some basic concepts. After this short overview, you can build your first CloudHub integration with the link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World on CloudHub] tutorial.

[NOTE]
====
The topics in this document deal with app deployments on both the cloud-based and the on-premise versions of the Runtime Manager. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-runtime-manager[CloudHub and Runtime Manager] for a better understanding of the differences between both.

CloudHub is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS). With the Anypoint Runtime Manager, it allows you to deploy sophisticated cross-cloud integration applications in the cloud, and on premises to servers, groups of servers, and clusters, create new APIs on top of existing data sources, integrate on premises applications with cloud services, manage servers and server groups on premises, and much more. This guide helps you learn the basics, and get started developing your first application.

== Why CloudHub?

=== Start Small, Think Big

CloudHub is an elastic cloud that scales on demand. You can start small and grow as your needs grow, all without changing your application. CloudHub provides you with a scalable architecture – one you can build integration applications on, publish REST APIs or Web Services, and much more. You can also manage servers in your organization from CloudHub and organize servers into groups that run an application.

=== Rock Solid Platform

Built on our battle-tested Mule integration platform, Mule ESB is used by thousands of companies for mission-critical applications. It's the world's most widely used platform for integration.

=== Integrate Cloud and Enterprise Applications

The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) feature provides a secure pipe to the enterprise, breaking down the "cloud silo." CloudHub allows you to integrate and orchestrate applications, data sources, and services across the enterprise and cloud.

=== Unrivaled Connectivity

Easily integrate with popular SaaS, cloud, and social media platforms such as Salesforce.com, Intuit, Authorize.net, Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, and PayPal using our predefined connectors – then orchestrate data between these services and the enterprise. Plus, our development kit allows developers to create new connectors easily. You don't even need knowledge of the underlying integration infrastructure.

=== Don't Change the Way You Code

Create CloudHub applications with the development tools you are already familiar with. Download link:https://www.mulesoft.com/ty/dl/studio[Anypoint Studio], it's free! Anypoint Studio is an Eclipse-based graphical environment that allows developers to easily choose to code in a visual environment with a palette of components, or in a familiar XML code view. You can even switch between the visual and code views as you build your application. Or, if you would rather use the command-line, we support Maven, as well as a command line tool.

=== Visibility and Control with the Anypoint Runtime Manager

With CloudHub, you also get our intuitive cloud console where you can manage your applications and servers, scale up and scale down, view event traffic, and much more. The Anypoint Runtime Manager allows you to manage every aspect of your CloudHub applications from one place. In addition, with link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers[server management] and link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#create-a-cluster[cluster management] you can manage your on-premise servers, server groups, and clusters, plus applications from your CloudHub console, giving you a single management pane of glass for all your applications and servers.

=== Behind a Great Platform is a Great API

Do you need to automate tasks, or build CloudHub into your deployment process? CloudHub has a link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-api[REST API] with which you can perform tasks such as manage and monitor your applications, scale your applications up or down, and more.


== CloudHub and Anypoint Studio



CloudHub is built on top of Mule, the most widely used integration platform. With Anypoint Studio – the user-friendly development tool – you can quickly build these integration applications and deploy to CloudHub with just a few clicks. This guide helps you learn the basics and get started developing your first applications.


=== Mule Flows

The underlying configuration for your CloudHub integration is a "Mule Flow". Mule flows are made of individual components called Message Processors. These components act as the building blocks for your integration. As you build your flow with message processors, you are defining how "messages" – or data-content – flows from one component to the next.

As an example, a CloudHub integration can monitor, or poll, your Salesforce instance for any changes across all of your accounts. When a change occurs, the integration converts the changed data to a CSV file, and then uploads the file to your on-premises SFTP site. The Mule flow would contain three Message Processors and look like this:

These flows are quickly assembled inside Mule Studio with just a few clicks and pieces of configuration. In just a few minutes you can have a complete working integration between your SaaS services and your on-premise systems.

=== Message Processors

Message processors allow you to do almost anything: connect to SaaS services, transform data, connect to various protocols, filter data, and much more. Each message processor has an icon in the Mule Studio Palette so you can drag it inside of your flow and configure it. Message processors fall into one of six categories, and are easy to locate in the Mule Studio Palette within their appropriate category:

|Category |Description
|link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/anypoint-connectors[Anypoint Connectors] |Anypoint Connectors connect via protocols or to SaaS services and on-premises applications such as as Salesforce, MongoDB, CMIS, NetSuite, Magento, Intacct, and many more systems. For a full list, see our link:http://www.mulesoft.org/connectors[list of connectors].
|link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/transformers[Transformers] |Transformers help you change from one data format to another. Use transformers out-of-the-box, or add scripts using your favorite scripting language.
|link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/scopes[Scopes] |Scopes provide advanced processing, such as asynchronous invocations, polling, sub flows, and more.
|link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/components[Components] |Components allow you to write reusable business logic with Java, or a scripting language, and also create or invoke web services.
|link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/filters[Filters] |Filters determine how messages can proceed through your Mule flow.
|link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/routers[Flow Controls] |Flow Controls allow you to route messages to different locations – whether another flows or different external service. They operate on collections of data, and can broadcast messages, and more.

== Applications

Flows are packaged into applications, and then deployed to CloudHub. It's nearly an automated process from within Mule Studio, as Anypoint Studio handles the packaging and upload of your application. You can build, deploy and run your integration without ever leaving Anypoint Studio.

=== Runtime Management Console

Once your application is deployed to CloudHub's multi-tenant runtime, you can link:http://anypoint.mulesoft.com[log in] to the Anypoint Platform, and then go to the Runtime Manager. It allows you to triage problems, view logs, set up alerts, view dashboards, and more. Follow the simple steps in the link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World] tutorial to setup your free Anypoint Platform account and deploy your first application to it.
