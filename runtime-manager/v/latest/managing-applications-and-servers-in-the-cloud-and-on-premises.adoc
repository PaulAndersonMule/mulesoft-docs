= Managing Applications and Servers in the Cloud and On Premises
:keywords: cloudhub, application, server, server group, on-premise, runtime manager, arm

With Anypoint Runtime Manager, CloudHub has gained an important new capability - in addition to managing your applications in the cloud, it can now manage applications, and servers, server groups, and clusters in your organization (on premises) as well. Anypoint Runtime Manager provides a single management interface where you can manage applications running in the cloud or on servers or groups of servers that are on premises within your data center. Applications that are on premises run on Mule Runtime instance(s) on a single server or a group of servers. For cluster information, see link:/runtime-manager/creating-and-managing-clusters[Creating and Managing Clusters].

[TIP]
====
*New functionality in API Gateway 2.0*

API Gateway 2.0 supports server auto configuration and a greatly simplified deployment both for on-premises servers and for CloudHub. For details, see <<Server Tasks>>.
====

== Getting Started

https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Log in to Anypoint Platform] and click *CloudHub*:

image:APStartScreen.png[APStartScreen]

The Applications tab appears.

=== Applications Tab

An application is a Mule Application that is running on a Mule or API Gateway instance. The instance can be running CloudHub, a server in an organization, or a group of servers. For server groups, an application deployed to the group runs on every server in the group. See <<Status States>> for possible values in the *Status* column.

image:AMC_Applications.png[AMC_Applications]

From the *Applications* tab, or by clicking an entry as shown, you can perform these tasks:

* <<Deploy an Application>>
* <<Start, Stop, and Delete an Application>>
* <<Manage an Application>>

=== Servers Tab

A server is a Mule or API Gateway instance that you register in the Anypoint Runtime Manager console.

image:AMC_Servers.png[AMC_Servers]

From the *Servers* tab, or by clicking an entry as shown, you can perform these tasks:

* <<Add a Server>> (registers the server with the Anypoint Runtime Manager console)
* <<Start Mule or API Gateway>>
* <<Create a Server Group>>
* <<Add a Server to a Server Group>>
* <<Stop an Application on a Server>>
* <<Remove a Server from a Server Group>>
* <<Delete a Server>>
* <<Delete a Server Group>>

== Application Tasks

The following sections describe the tasks you can perform for applications.

Topics:

* <<Deploy an Application>>
* <<Start, Stop, and Delete an Application>>
* <<Manage an Application>>

=== Deploy an Application

Deploy an application means that you want your application to run on CloudHub, or a server or server group in your organization. Use Anypoint Studio to create an application as described in link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World on CloudHub]. 

In the Applications screen, click *Deploy application*: 

image:AMC_DeployApp.png[AMC_DeployApp]

Specify:

* *Application Name* - An application name that consists of at least 3 characters in length with a maximum of 40 characters, containing only letters, numbers, or dashes, and cannot start with a dash.
+
* *Deployment Target* - From the drop-down list, click *CloudHub*, a server name, or a server group for where you want to deploy your application. CloudHub means you're deploying to the cloud, whereas a server or group means you're deploying an application to one or more servers in your organization's data center.
+
If you click *CloudHub*, also supply:
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Tab |Values
|*Runtime* |Runtime version, worker size, workers, region, and restart options
|*Properties* |Key value pairs
|*Insight* |link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-insight[CloudHub Insight] values for metadata and replay
|*Logging* |Log level and categories to include in logs
|===
+
* *Application File* - A zip file created by Anypoint Studio. To create the file in Studio, export your project from Studio as a zip file and import it into Anypoint Runtime Manager.

The bell icon in the upper right corner lets you manage notifications. For more information, see link:/runtime-manager/alerts-and-notifications[Managing Notifications] in the link:/runtime-manager/alerts-and-notifications[Alerts and Notifications] guide.

=== Start, Stop, or Delete an Application

To start, stop, or delete an application, click an application, and click the status down-arrow (the menus differ by Status):

image:AMC_StopStartDeleteApp.png[AMC_StopStartDeleteApp]

Click *Start*, *Stop*, or *Delete* as needed. The *Start* command restarts stopped applications, and if the application is Undeployed, sends the application's zip file to the server to start the application on the server.

=== Manage an Application

Managing an application lets you view a dashboard that lists Mule Messages, CPU use, memory use, and any of the categories of commands in the left navigation area, such as viewing logs, alerts, queues, change settings, debugging, and more.

To manage an application, click *Manage Application*: 

image:AMC_ManageApplication.png[AMC_ManageApplication]

An example is (what displays may vary by permissions):

For more information on the features, see the link:/runtime-manager/managing-cloudhub-applications[Managing CloudHub Applications] in the MuleSoft documentation set.

== Server Tasks

=== Prerequisites

In order to perform on-premises server management, you need to have one of the following installed on your on-premises server:

 * Mule ESB – Version 3.6 or above
 * API Gateway Standalone – Version 2.0 or above

For details on configuring an API Gateway, see link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/configuring-an-api-gateway[Configuring an API Gateway].

[NOTE]
This document assumes that you are using API Gateway 2.0 installed. The steps needed to complete server tasks differ between API Gateway 2.0 and previous versions. MuleSoft recommends that you always use the latest version of API Gateway.

The following tasks let you manage the Mule servers in your organization using CloudHub.

Topics:

* <<Add a Server>> (registers the server with the Anypoint Runtime Manager console)
* <<Start Mule or API Gateway>>
* <<Create a Server Group>>
* <<Add a Server to a Server Group>>
* <<Stop an Application on a Server>>
* <<Remove a Server from a Server Group>>
* <<Delete a Server>>
* <<Delete a Server Group>>

=== Add a Server

To add a server:

. Go to the *Servers* tab in CloudHub.
. If the environment already contains servers, click *Add Server* to add an additional server.
+
The *Servers* screen displays a command that you must run from each server or API Gateway on premise instance so that you can manage the server or on-premise gateway from CloudHub. Each command contains information unique to your organization.
+
image:empty_servers-add_server_1st_srv-CORR.COMM-REAL-2.png[empty_servers-add_server_1st_srv-CORR.COMM-REAL-2]
+
. Run the displayed command (listed below) to add each Mule server, or API Gateway (that runs on a server). Running this command enables the Mule server or API Gateway to communicate with Anypoint Runtime Manager. The key included in the `-H` parameter (partly redacted in the image above) is a token generated specifically for your Mule server or API Gateway to authenticate against Anypoint Runtime Manager.
+
To run this command:
+
.. In Anypoint Runtime Manager, click *Copy* to copy the displayed command to your clipboard.
.. Open a terminal in the server where your Mule server or API Gateway resides.
.. Go to the `bin` directory inside the Mule server or API Gateway root directory.
.. Paste the command into your terminal.
.. Substitute the last parameter, `server-name`, with the name you want for your server. In the example below, the name is `srv1`.
+
[source,java, linenums]
----
./amc_setup -H 17958da2-[redacted]---1942 srv1
----
+
[TIP]
If running Windows, substitute `amc_setup.bat` for `./amc_setup` (without `./`).
+
.. Press Enter to run the command.
. Check that the command output on your terminal states that the credentials extracted correctly:
. In the *Servers* screen of Anypoint Runtime Manager, you should see that your server (named `srv1` in this example) is listed as *Created*:
+
image:srv1_created.png[srv1_created]

=== Start Mule or API Gateway

. Start your Mule server or API Gateway. To do so, change directory to the MuleSoft `bin` directory:
** For Mule Server: Run `./mule`
** For API Gateway: Run `./gateway` or `./gateway start`. The first command retains the gateway process in the terminal foreground; when you want to stop the gateway, press `CTRL-C`. If you are running API Gateway in the foreground, your terminal fills with startup messages.
+
. In the *Servers* screen of Anypoint Runtime Manager, your server's status changes first to *Connected*, then to *Running:*
+
image:srv1_running.png[srv1_running]

At this point, you have successfully added server `srv1`.

==== About the amc_setup Command

The `amc_setup` command described above resides in `$MULE_HOME/bin`. If you do not run it from this directory, you have to either set the `MULE_HOME` environment variable before running the command, or use the `--mule-home` parameter:

[source,java, linenums]
----
/opt/mule-3.7.0/bin/amc_setup --mule-home /opt/mule-3.7.0 -H ...
----

The `amc_setup` script actually invokes the link:/mule-agent/v/1.3.0/[Mule agent] installation script, which has several useful parameters for configuring security and proxies. For details on the options, see *Installation Options* in link:/mule-agent/v/1.3.0/installing-mule-agent[Installing Mule Agent].

==== About the Server Registration Token

The registration token provided by Anypoint Runtime Manager (included in the command with the `-H` parameter) is specific to a single environment. For example, if you register a server in a QA environment by clicking *Add Server*, you get one token. However if you try to register into your *Production* environment by also clicking *Add Server,*  you get a different token. Tokens are specific to the environment in which you register a server. You can only copy and paste a token to register multiple Mules if you want all servers to be in the same environment.

=== Create a Server Group

A server group organizes servers into functional units such as for Accounting, Engineering, or Human Resources. The servers reside in your organization and are managed using CloudHub. A server group is a set of servers that act as a single deployment target. An application runs on one or more of the servers as you indicate when you deploy an application.

Click *Create Group*:

image:CreateGroup.png[CreateGroup]

This displays:

image:AMC_CreateServerGroup.png[AMC_CreateServerGroup]

Give the server group a name, click the checkbox for each server to include in the group, and click *Create Group*.

=== Add a Server to a Server Group

If you want to add a server to a group that is currently running an existing application, you must first stop and and delete the application before you can add the server to a group.

From the Servers screen, click a server to view the additional menu, and click *Add Servers*:

image:AddServersToGroup.png[AddServersToGroup]

After you select servers to add to the group, click *Add to Group*:

image:AddToGroup.png[AddToGroup]

=== Stop an Application on a Server

You can stop an application that is currently running on a server from the drop-down menu in the Status menu:

image:StopAppOnServer.png[StopAppOnServer]

=== Delete a Server

To delete a server, click a server entry to display the detail view on the right side of the screen. 

Click the down arrow below the server name and click *Delete*.

image:DeleteServer.png[DeleteServer]

=== Remove a Server from a Server Group

To remove a server from a server group, expand the server group entry in the Servers tab and click the *X* icon at the far right of the entry:

image:RemoveServerFromAGroup.png[RemoveServerFromAGroup]

Anypoint Connection Manager displays a verification prompt. Click the check box and click *Remove*.

image:RemoveVerifyPrompt.png[RemoveVerifyPrompt]

=== Delete a Server Group

To remove a server group, click the down arrow from an expanded view of a server group, and click *Delete Group*:

image:DeleteGroup.png[DeleteGroup]
