= CloudHub and Runtime Manager
:keywords: cloudhub, cloud, api, runtime manager, arm



The Anypoint Runtime Manager offers you several different ways to deploy your Mule applications:

* Through the link:anypoint.mulesoft.com[Cloud console] of the Anypoint Runtime Manager to *CloudHub*
* Through the link:anypoint.mulesoft.com[Cloud console] of the Anypoint Runtime Manager to *another server* (which may be on premises or a different cloud server)
* Through the link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/[on premise edition] of the Anypoint Runtime Manager to *a server you manage*

These different modalities offer different management features. The key reason behind these differences is that both use a different link:/mule-agent/[Mule Agent] in their communication to the servers.
* When deploying to CloudHub, the old agent is used. This agent was originally created for link:/mule-management-console/[MMC].
* When deploying to a server you manage, regardless of if you do this through the cloud console or the on-premises Runtime Manager console, the new link:/mule-agent/[Mule Agent] is used.


== Management Features

CloudHub is a complete Platform as a Service that covers all of your server needs out of the box, including logging, analytics, alerts, scheduling, etc. Hosting your apps on your own servers allows for greater flexibility and tighter security (in case you deploy to your own secured on-premises environment) but requires that you sort out several considerations by your own means. When deploying to your own servers, you have the flexibility to group them into link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#create-a-server-group[Server Groups] or link:/runtime-manager/managing-servers#create-a-cluster[Clusters] and configure various parameters to handle them.

The different available modalities also offer different management features because both communicate to deployment servers using a different version of the link:/mule-agent/[Mule Agent].

* When deploying to a CloudHub worker, the old agent is used. (this is the same agent used by link:/mule-management-console/[MMC])
* When deploying to a server you manage – regardless of if you do this through a cloud or on-premise console – the new link:/mule-agent/[Mule Agent] is used.

Although the long term plan is to converge the features of these deployment scenarios so that they all offer the whole set of capabilities, currently they have the following differences:

|===
Deploying to a CloudHub worker | Deploying to a server you manage |
link:/runtime-manager/logs[Logs are handled] by CloudHub | You can configure the Runtime Manager to send data link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[to External Monitoring Software] such as Splunk or ELK|
CloudHub has its own link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-insight[Insight Engine]| You can configure the Runtime Manager to send data link:/runtime-manager/sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software[to External Monitoring Software] such as Splunk or ELK|
You can manage link:/runtime-manager/managing-schedules[Schedules] through the Runtime Manager UI | You must use the link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/poll-schedulers[Poll Scheduler] element in your flows to schedule tasks |
CloudHub has its own preconfigured default link:/runtime-manager/managing-application-data-with-object-stores[Object Store] you can reference. To use it, simply add an link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-object-stores[Object Store connector] and set its 'config_ref' to point to the default CloudHub Object Store.|
To use link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/mule-object-stores[Object Stores] you must configure your own database to store data |
You can manage link:/runtime-manager/alerts-and-notifications[Alerts and Notifications] through the Runtime Manager UI  | You must build alerts and notifications into the logic of your flows |
|===

== Shared Resource Support

link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/shared-resources[Domains] in Mule offer you the possibility of reusing configurations amongst several applications.

Since every application in CloudHub is already running on its own separate virtual server, no domains are needed when deploying to CloudHub.

Currently, you can't deploy domains through the Runtime Manager console, even to external servers where they could be needed in some scenarios. In those cases, you can still deploy your domains manually directly on your local server through the command line.
