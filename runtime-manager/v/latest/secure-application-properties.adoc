= Secure Application Properties
:keywords: cloudhub, jdbc, security

CloudHub supports *secure application properties*, where the name of a property is visible in the console, but the value is not displayed or retrievable by a user. CloudHub resolves the property at runtime without exposing the sensitive information.

[NOTE]
Application properties are a feature that is currently only available for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. They are not available for applications that you deploy via the Runtime Manager to external servers on premises or in the cloud. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-runtime-manager[CloudHub and Runtime Manager] for more details.

== Use Case

Application Properties are variables that act as placeholders in your Mule application, and which are set in your Mule server at runtime. The Mule server supplies the values for the variables using information you configure in the Runtime Manager console when you deploy an application or update an existing application in the Deployment tab.

For example, you can configure a JDBC connector where the username is set to `${dbUsername}` and the password is set to `${dbPassword}`. In the Runtime Manager console, you can set these two properties as application properties, as shown below.

However, for sensitive information, you may wish to flag these properties as secure so that, after they are entered and saved in the Runtime Manager console, their values are neither visible in the console nor passed between the console and the CloudHub server.

== Creating Secure Application Properties

To create secure application properties:

. Identify the property names that you wish to secure in your `mule-app.properties` file by listing them as `secure.properties`. In the example below, there are four total properties used in the application (lines 1-4 below), which have been defined in the mule-app.properties file with values for local testing (optional). Line 5 flags two of the properties as secure. 
+
.mule-app.properties
[source,json, linenums]
----
1. http.port=8081
2. username=testuser
3. password=testpass123
4. birthdate=01/01/2015
5. secure.properties=password, birthdate
----
+
. Deploy the Mule application to CloudHub. 
. Enter your application properties as you normally would.

+
. Commit your deployment or update. Once your application is deployed, navigate to the Deployment tab and check the application properties. The values for all properties that you had marked as secured are now no longer visible to you or any other user. In the example below, birthdate and password are secured, but username is not.

+
. Note that, once the values are committed and the application is uploaded, the secured properties are never displayed on the console, nor sent and received between the console and the CloudHub server. There is no way to retrieve the property, once set. It can, however, be overwritten with a new value. So, if you need to update a value, type a new value into the field, as shown below.

+
Once an application is deployed with secured properties, CloudHub maintains the security flag for those properties. Even if you edit your application file to remove the `secure.properties` definitions from your `mule-app.properties` file and then upload that edited application file to CloudHub, CloudHub maintains the security of the properties previously flagged as secure.

[NOTE]
====
*Copying Secure Environment Variables between Sandboxes*

Note that when moving applications between link:/anypoint-platform-administration/managing-cloudhub-environments[sandboxes], secured application property values will _not_ be copied to the new environment. For all secured application properties, the name of the property will be copied, but the value will be left blank.
