You can easily integrate your CloudHub application with MySQL or Oracle using Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS). Refer to the link:http://aws.amazon.com/rds/[Amazon RDS documentation] to learn how to set up a new database.

Before using CloudHub with Amazon RDS, you must configure RDS security. This allows Mule to communicate with Amazon RDS. To configure RDS security:

* Log into the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home[AWS Console].
* Go to the RDS tab.
* Select *DB Security Groups* in the left hand navigation.
* Select the security group for your database instance.
* In the bottom pane, select *EC2 Security Group* in the Connection Type column.
* Enter *ion-mule* as the security group and *494141260463* as the AWS Account ID.

You can now use the JDBC connector inside your CloudHub application with RDS.
