= Deploying a CloudHub Application
:keywords: cloudhub, cloud, deploy, manage

You can deploy a CloudHub application from:

* *Anypoint Studio* - Right-click your project and click *Deploy to Anypoint Platform* -> *Cloud*. For an example of deploying to CloudHub directly from Anypoint Studio, see link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World on CloudHub].
* *CloudHub* - From the Applications tab, click the *Deploy application* button. This page describes the options on the Deploy Application page.

[NOTE]
====
In the cloud version of the link:anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform], your Mule deployments to the cloud and to servers on premises are managed through the *CloudHub* section. In the downloadable link:/anypoint-platform-on-premises/v/1.1.0[Aynpoint Platform On Premises Edition], the section that manages your deployments to on premise servers is named *Anypoint Runtime Manager*.

The topics in this document deal with app deployments on both these scenarios. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-and-runtime-manager[CloudHub and Runtime Manager] for a better understanding of the differences between both.

=== Creating an Application Name

Every application requires a unique application domain name. The application domain identifies your application in CloudHub and also provides you with a public URL, `http://myapplicationdomain.cloudhub.io`, for accessing the application if it exposes any inbound endpoints.

To deploy an application, click *Deploy application* on the CloudHub console. in the *Deploy Application* dialog, enter a unique application name. The Application Name also becomes the `cloudhub.io` domain name that you use to access your application; for example the Application Name, `abcde` is accessible at `http://abcde.cloudhub.io`. Valid names contain alphanumeric characters and dashes, and contain at most 40 characters. If the name is valid, CloudHub alerts you whether it is available or already reserved by another user.

=== Deployment Target

CloudHub lets you specify where you want to deploy your application:

* On the CloudHub worker cloud
* On an on-premises server, server group, or cluster

For more information on deploying to a server or server group, see link:/runtime-manager/managing-applications-and-servers-in-the-cloud-and-on-premises[Managing Applications and Servers in the Cloud and On Premises].

== Application File

Upload a new file for deployment. Click the *Choose file* button, select your application file, and then click *Open*. You can also click the *Get from sandbox* button to copy a file from a non-production environment into your current environment. (If the Get From Sandbox button does not appear, you may first need to create a non-production environment to view this option.) 

*Note*: The application file size limit is 100 MB.

=== Runtime Version

Using the drop-down menu, select the *Runtime version* to which you to deploy:

image:RuntimeVersion2.png[RuntimeVersion2]

[IMPORTANT]
====
* Ensure that the runtime version is the same Mule version used to develop your application. For example, if you use the default value prod-3.5.0 and your application uses the new HTTP connector introduced in Mule 3.6 and newer, your application won't deploy and the log contains errors.
* To see what runtime version you set when you deployed your application, click the *Applications* tab and click your application. In the expansion view on the right, click *Manage Application*. Click *Settings* to see the deployment values.
====

=== Worker Sizing

After you deploy your application, you can allocate an amount and a size for the *Worker size* of your application. On each application, workers are responsible for executing your application logic. 

There are 5 different worker sizes to choose from, with the compute and memory capacities described in the following table:

[cols=",,,,,",]
|===
|*Worker Sizes* |0.1 vCores +
 500 MB Mem |0.2 vCores +
 1 GB Mem |1 vCores +
 1.5 GB Mem |2 vCores +
 3.5 GB Mem |4 vCores +
 7.5 GB Mem
|===

Workers that have less than 1 vCore capacity (0.1 vCores and 0.2 vCores)  offer limited CPU and IO for smaller work loads. They are intended for use in test applications or applications that run intermittently and have limited compute capacity requirements, not for long running production applications with significant compute capacity requirements.

Each worker has 8 GB of storage, which is used for both system and application storage. Applications with greater storage needs (verbose logging etc.) should use one of the larger worker sizes - 2 vCores or 4 vCores, which have additional storage as follows:

* 2 vCores workers have an additional 32 GB of SSD storage mounted on /tmp
* 4 vCores workers have an additional 80 GB of storage, mounted as two volumes on /tmp (40 GB), and /opt/storage (40 GB)

[IMPORTANT]
The workers with additional storage as listed above are only available for Mule runtimes 3.6.2 or later, or API Gateway 2.0.2 or later.

To select the worker size and amount of each, select options from the drop-down menu to configure the computing power you need:

image:WorkerSizeAndQty.png[WorkerSizeAndQty]

Depending on how many vCores your account possesses, some of these options may not be eligible, as you may not have enough available capacity.

[IMPORTANT]
If you select more vCores than are available in your account, CloudHub allows you to create the application using the console, but you cannot start your application until vCores are available.

When deploying an application with more than one worker, CloudHub automatically load-balances any incoming traffic across your allocated workers. For more information, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-fabric[CloudHub Fabric].

=== Region

If you have global deployment enabled on your account, you can change the *Region* to which your application deploys using the drop-down menu. Administrators can link:/anypoint-platform-administration/managing-cloudhub-specific-settings[set the default region] on the Organization tab in Account Settings, but that region can be adjusted here when the application is deployed, if necessary.

* Note that applications deployed to Europe automatically have their domain updated to  `http://myapplicationdomain.eu.cloudhub.io`. 
* Note that applications deployed to Asia / Pacific automatically have their domain updated to `http://myapplicationdomain.au.cloudhub.io.`

=== Secure Data Gateway

Click the Secure data gateway checkbox if your application has a link:/runtime-manager/secure-data-gateway[secure data gateway] attached to it.

=== Persistent Queues

Check this box to enable persistent queues on your application. Persistent queues protect against message loss and allow you to distribute workloads across a set of workers. Before you can take advantage of persistent queueing, your application needs to be set up to use queues. See link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-fabric[CloudHub Fabric] for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
If your mule application is using link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/batch-processing[Batch] component and persistent queues, then you might see batch record being processed multiple times. All batch records are stored in Amazon SQS and by default the visibility of the message is set to 70 seconds. If your batch process takes longer than 70 seconds, then batch process might see same message again and process it multiple times.  To avoid this issue please set 'persistent.queue.min.timeout' system parameter to a reasonable value, for example if your batch process takes 30 minutes to complete then set value to 'persistent.queue.min.timeout=2700000' milliseconds ( 45 Minutes). Maximum value of 43000000 milliseconds (12 hours) is supported. See screen shot below for setting the value in cloudhub
image:MuleBatchWithPersistentQueueDuplicationSolution.png[MuleBatchWithPersistentQueues]

=== Automatic Restart

If you are deploying to a runtime that supports worker monitoring (3.4.0 runtime or later), you have the option to check *Automatically restart application when not responding*. With this box checked, CloudHub automatically restarts your application when the monitoring system discovers a problem with your application. If this box is not checked, CloudHub produces all the log messages, notifications, and any configured alerts, but takes no action to restart the application. 

Read more about worker monitoring.

=== Properties Tab

You can also optionally specify properties that your application requires. This allows you to externalize important pieces of configuration which may switch depending on the environment in which you're deploying. For example, if you're using a Mule application locally, you might configure your database host to be localhost. But if you're using CloudHub, you might configure it to be an Amazon RDS server.

To create an application property, click the *Properties* tab and set the variable by either using a text  `key=value` format or by using the list format with two text boxes. After you've made the change, click *Apply Changes*. 

image:PropertiesTab.png[PropertiesTab]

These application properties can be used inside your Mule configuration. For example:

[source, xml, linenums]
----
<spring:bean id="jdbcDataSource" class="org.enhydra.jdbc.standard.StandardDataSource" destroy-method="shutdown">
   <spring:property name="driverName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
   <spring:property name="url"value="${database.url}"/>
</spring:bean>
----

If you also have the same properties set in a mule-app.properties file inside your application, the application property settings in CloudHub override mule-app.properties when your application is deployed.

Note that you can flag application properties as secure so that their values are not visible to users at runtime or passed between the server and the console. See link:/runtime-manager/secure-application-properties[Secure Application Properties] for more information.

=== Insight Tab

The Insight tab lets you specify metadata options for the Insight analytics feature. For more information, see the link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-insight[CloudHub Insight] document.

image:CHInsightTab.png[CHInsightTab]

=== Logging Tab

The Logging tab lets you change the logging setting (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, or ERROR). For more information,
see link:/runtime-manager/viewing-log-data[Viewing Log Data].

image:CHLoggingTab.png[CHLoggingTab]

=== Static IPs Tab

To enable a static IP address for your application, go to the *Static IPs* tab, then check the *Use Static IP* checkbox.

image:static-ip-tab.png[Static IP tab]

To pre-allocate static IPs for your application, select a region from the *Region* dropdown menu, then click *Allocate Static IP* to allocate a static IP for the chosen region. The static IP address is allocated when the application is deployed to that region. If the application is already running, applying the static IP change  triggers a restart of the application with the newly-applied static IP.

image:static-ip-regions.png[Static IPs by region]

Applications with static IPs can only have one instance.

By default, the number of static IPs allocated to your organization is equal to twice the number of Production vCores in your subscription. This number is displayed under the *Use Static IP* checkbox. If you need to increase this quota, you can contact link:https://www.mulesoft.com/support-and-services/mule-esb-support-license-subscription[MuleSoft Support].

If an application has static IPs reserved in multiple regions, it picks up the IP from whichever region it is deployed to. This allows you to pre-configure IP rules for multiple regions, for disaster recovery (DR) scenario.

If you need to free up some of your overall static IP allocation, you can release a static IP that is currently allocated to an application.

== CloudHub Deployment

After you complete the above steps, click *Create* and CloudHub uploads your application and automatically begins the deployment process. During this process, your view is switched to the log view allowing you to monitor the process of your application deployment. This process could take several minutes. During the deployment, the application status indicator changes to yellow to indicate deployment in progress.

When deployment is complete, the application status indicator changes to green and you are notified in the status area that the application has deployed successfully. Here's what is in the logs:

[source, code]
----
Successfully deployed [mule application name]
----

== Deploy to CloudHub from Anypoint Studio

You can easily deploy your applications to CloudHub, straight from Anypoint Studio. This is specially helpful if you're still developing the application and want to deploy it often to an online test environment. To do this, left click on the application in the package explorer, *Deploy to Anypoint Platform*.

image:CHDeployToCH.png[CHDeployToCH]

If this is your first time deploying in this way, a popup menu asks you to provide your login credentials for the Anypoint Platform. Your credentials are then  stored and used automatically next time you deploy to Runtime Manager. You can manage these credentials through the Studio preferences menu, in *Anypoint Studio* > *Authentication*.

image:studio-to-cloudhub3.png[studio to cloudhub3]

Once you have signed in, the Deploy to CloudHub menu opens. Choose a unique domain to deploy the application to, the sub organization under which you deploy, an environment, and a Mule Version. You can also assign environment variables.

image:deploy-from-studio.jpg[deploy-from-studio]

== Automatically Deploying a Proxy from the Anypoint Platform for APIs

If you've registered an API in the Anypoint Platform, you can easily run it through an auto generated proxy to track its usage and implement policies. You can deploy this proxy to CloudHub without ever needing to go into the CloudHub section of the Anypoint platform. From a menu in the API version page, you can trigger the deployment of your proxy and set up the application name in CloudHub, the CloudHub environment and the Gateway version to use. Then, you can optionally access the CloudHub deployment menu for this proxy and configure advanced settings. See link:/anypoint-platform-for-apis/proxying-your-api[Proxying Your API].

== Deployment Errors

If an error occurs and the application cannot be deployed, the application status indicator changes to red. You are alerted in the status area that an error occurred. Check the log details for any application deployment errors. You need to correct the error, upload the application, and deploy again.
