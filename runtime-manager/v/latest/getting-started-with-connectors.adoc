:keywords: cloudhub, connectors, tutorial, runtime manager, arm


This tutorial follows link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World on CloudHub] as the second installment in the CloudHub introductory documents. It introduces the Twitter Connector, and describes additional CloudHub concepts. After completing this tutorial, you can see how to leverage Anypoint™ Connectors for a wide array of integration solutions with CloudHub.

This tutorial takes about 45 minutes and helps you:

* Learn about connectors, and build a project that accesses the Twitter API using Anypoint Studio
* Learn about Mule Expression Language
* Learn about the Expression Transformer and the Logger Component
* Walk through the sign-up process for obtaining Twitter API access and credentials
* Learn more about the CloudHub Dashboard, and how to monitor and debug your project once deployed to CloudHub

== Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the concepts covered in link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World on CloudHub]. Take a moment to review them if you haven't already done so.

You also need to enable your Twitter account for API access with write privileges.
See the Connector Guide link in the link:https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/twitter-integration-connector[Anypoint Exchange Twitter Connector] for instructions on doing so.

== Project Overview

With Anypoint connectors, you can leverage many Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platforms and quickly build cloud-to-cloud integrations, cloud-to-on-site applications, and much more. This tutorial introduces you to the Twitter connector, and shows you how to configure it to access your Twitter account. The tutorial also discusses payloads and shows you how to use expressions, using Mule Expression Language, to modify and view messages at various points in the project flow.

*Key Concepts Covered in this Tutorial:*

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Concept |Description
|*Twitter Connector* |To demonstrate how connectors simplify API integration, this project builds on the Twitter connector to access a Twitter user stream and post status updates.
|*HTTP Connector* |The HTTP connector (also discussed in the link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World on CloudHub]) provides a web page for sending Twitter status updates via the URL query string.
|*Expression Transformer* |The Expression Transformer sends a response to the web page.
|*Logger* |The Logger component updates the Runtime Manager console with payload data.
|*Mule Expression Language* |Mule Expression Language is used in various components to process the payload.
|*Runtime Manager* |An introduction to the Runtime Manager console is provided, including details on starting, stopping applications, and viewing system log messages.
|===

*Running the Project:*

After you build and deploy this project to Runtime Manager, you can run the project by opening a web browser and pointing it to the website produced by the HTTP connector. Then add a query string to the website URL. This query string is captured as a message in the Mule flow, using Mule Expression Language (MEL), and sent to your Twitter user stream by the Twitter connector.

As an example, if you deploy this application to the domain *twittertutorial*, the following URL sends a Tweet, "I just built a CloudHub integration using an Anypoint Connector", to your Twitter user stream:

[source,bash, linenums]
----
http://twittertutorial.cloudhub.io/sendtweet?tweet=I just built a CloudHub integration using an Anypoint Connector
----

== Step 1: Create a New Anypoint Studio Project

To begin building this application, start Anypoint Studio and create a new project:

. Select *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*
. In the New Mule Project configuration menu, provide a name for this project: *posttweets*
. Click *Finish*.

A new project opens with a blank canvas for building the flow.

== Step 2: Configure the HTTP Connector

The first message processor in the flow is an HTTP Connector. This listener launches a web page at the URL you choose when deploying the project.

. Locate **HTTP** in the *Connectors* category of the Palette. Drag and place it on the canvas.
. Open the HTTP properties editor by clicking the icon you just placed on the canvas.
. Change the *Display Name* to something more meaningful, such as *Launch Website*.
. Enter *sendtweet* in the Path field.
. Create a new *Connector Configuration* element by clicking the green plus sign  `+`.
. Fill in the two required fields: *Host* and *Port*. Set the host to *All Interfaces [0.0.0.0] (Default)* and the port to `${http.port}`
+
[width="100%",cols="30%,70%",options="header",]
|===
a|
Field

 a|
Value

|*Name* |*HTTP_Listener_Configuration*
|*Host* | *All Interfaces [0.0.0.0] (Default)*
|*Port* |`${http.port}`
|===
+
. In Studio's Package Explorer, right-click your project name, and open the *mule-app.properties* file under *src/main/app* and insert this statement: +
+
`http.port=8081`
+
. Save the properties file and save your project.

[TIP]
When deploying to CloudHub, always use host *0.0.0.0* and port `${http.port}` (as discussed in the link:/runtime-manager/hello-world-on-cloudhub[Hello World on CloudHub][Hello World Tutorial]). The port value lets CloudHub assign a dynamic port when deployed.

== Step 3: Configure the Twitter Connector

Before configuring the Twitter connector in Anypoint Studio, grant your Twitter account **API access**. This allows the Twitter connector to post to your user stream.

If you've never registered an application with Twitter before, read link:/runtime-manager/configure-twitter-for-api-access[Configure Twitter for API Access] for instructions. Also, be sure to enable *read and write* access as discussed in the configure document, which requires registering your mobile phone with Twitter. You need the read and write permissions, as the default read-only permissions do not allow the Twitter connector to post Tweets to your user stream.

After you obtain API access, the Application Management screen opens.

1.  Click the *Keys and Access Tokens* tab.
2.  Scroll down in the Keys and Access Tokens screen and click *Create my access token*.
3.  Copy the following credentials from your Twitter API application page to the Twitter connector configuration:
+
** Consumer Key
** Consumer Secret
** Access Token
** Access Token Secret
+
For example:
+

=== Integrate the Twitter Connector

Follow these steps in Anypoint Studio to integrate the Twitter connector:

. Locate *Twitter* in the *Connectors* category of the Palette. Drag and place it on the canvas to the right of the HTTP Connector. If you are prompted for a Twitter version, click *Use newest*.
+
image:posttweetsflow.png[posttweetsflow]
. Click the *Twitter* connector in your flow to open its properties editor.
. An error message indicates `Attribute 'config-ref' is required`, and that one of the red "x" values is next to the *Connector Configuration* field. Click the green *+* icon to the right of *Connector Configuration*.
.  The *Global Element Properties* menu opens. From the Twitter web site, plug in the values from the Twitter web site into the fields in the Twitter connector:
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===============================================
|Twitter Web Site Value |Twitter Connector Value
|Consumer Key |Consumer Key
|Consumer Secret |Consumer Secret
|Access Token |Access Key
|Access Token Secret |Access Secret
|===============================================
+
[TIP]
A _Global Element_ lets you enter configuration information, such as your API credentials, once. You can then reference the Global Element many times within your flow (although for this project we only need to reference it once). Note the *Global Elements* tab under the Anypoint Studio canvas; this tab provides an alternative view for managing all Global Elements defined for this project. 
+
. Leave *Use SSL* checked (Twitter requires a SSL connection). 
 +
image:TwitterGlobalProps.png[TwitterGlobalProps]
. Click *Test Connection*. If the information you entered is correct, this message displays:
+
image:TwitterTestConnection.png[TwitterTestConnection] 
. Click  *OK*  to close the Global Elements Properties menu.
. Notice that in the Twitter connector properties editor, the Connector Configuration field has been updated to point to the new *Twitter* Global Element.
. Select *Update Status* from the *Operation* drop-down field. This changes the fields below the Operation field.
. In the Status field, enter: 
+
`#[message.inboundProperties['http.query.params']['tweet']]`
+
This is a Mule Expression Language (MEL) expression, which is discussed later in this tutorial.
+
The Properties screen appears as:
+
image:TwitterProperties.png[TwitterProperties] 

The Twitter connector configuration is complete – click the save icon to save your configuration and click the Twitter icon on the Studio canvas. The red "x" next to its icon in the flow is no longer present.

== Step 4: Configure the Expression Transformer

After the Twitter connector sends a Tweet to your user stream, it's a good idea to also return a response to the web page. We can do so by adding an Expression Transformer after the Twitter Connector.

. Locate the *Expression* component in the *Transformers* category of the Palette. Drag and place it on the canvas to the right of the Twitter Connector.
+
image:TwitterFlowWithExpression.png[TwitterFlowWithExpression]
. Click the *Expression* Transformer to open its properties editor.
. Change the Display Name to *Return Website Response.*
. In the *Expression* field, enter:
+
`"Thanks for Tweeting! Your message:" #[message.payload.text]`
+
image:TwitterExpression.png[TwitterExpression]

== Step 5: Add Logger Components

The Logger component is commonly used in CloudHub applications, as it can provide a detailed view of the information contained in a message at any specific point (or multiple points) in the flow. The Logger component is configured with an expression, and as the application runs, the result of this expression is sent to the Runtime Manager console.

In this project, we add two Logger components to the flow. In doing so, we can view the data going into the Twitter Connector, and the subsequent response payload produced by Twitter.

. Locate *Logger* in the *Components* category of the Palette. Place a Logger between the HTTP Endpoint and the Twitter Connector.
. Drag another Logger component form the Palette and place it between the Twitter Connector and the Expression Transformer. Your flow should now look like this:
+
image:TwitterWithLoggers.png[TwitterWithLoggers]
+
. Open the configuration menu for the first Logger component.
. Change the Display Name to: *Log Query String*
. Add the following expression to the Message field:
+
`"Tweet:" + #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.tweet]`
+
image:TwitterLogQueryString.png[TwitterLogQueryString]
+
. Open the properties editor for the second Logger component.
. Change the Display Name to *Log Payload*.
. Add the following expression to the Message field:
+
`#[payload]`
+
image:TwitterLogPayload.png[TwitterLogPayload]

*Note*: In both cases, leave the Level set to *INFO*, as this generates log entries while the application runs normally. If set to ERROR, as an example, log entries would only be generated on an error while executing the application, which is useful for debugging issues.

== Step 6: Deploy Your Application to CloudHub

Before deploying your application, it's helpful to go to the Runtime Manager Console. The benefits of doing so include:

* You can watch your application deploy as events display in the console.
* Since your application includes Logger components, the log console displays events as they are encountered in the flow.
* Finally, if things don't go as expected, and you become inundated with posts to your Twitter user stream, as an example, you can quickly stop the application from the Runtime Manager Console.

If you are using a free Anypoint Platform account, you need to stop any other application that might be running before deploying this new application (or upgrade to a paid plan so you can run multiple applications).

=== Sign In and Go to the Runtime Manager Console

. link:https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin[Sign in to the Anypoint Platform] and go to the Runtime Manager Console by clicking on *Runtime Manager* from the top menu.
. After you sign in, click *Runtime Manager*:
+
image:APStartScreen.png[APStartScreen]
. You can then see your applications – Click an entry to view the additional detail menu on the right:
+
image:AMC_Applications.png[AMC_Applications]

CloudHub now lets you manage servers and groups of servers that run your application either in the cloud or on a server in your organization.

=== Deploy Your Application

Now go back to Anypoint Studio to deploy your application.

. Save your project by choosing *File* > *Save*.
. Locate the project name in the Package Explorer view, right-click and choose:
+
*CloudHub* > *Deploy to CloudHub*
+
. Enter your Anypoint Platform username and password:
+
image:TwitterAnypointLogin.png[TwitterAnypointLogin]
+
.  Studio prompts you for a domain name and to set the Mule Runtime version:
+
image:DeployDomainPrompt.png[DeployDomainPrompt]
+
.  Specify the *Domain*. When you enter a unique domain name, a green check appears.
.  Change the *Mule Version* to *3.7.0* or newer:
+
image:TwitterDeployToCHDone.png[TwitterDeployToCHDone]

.  Click *Finish*.
.  If the deployment succeeds, this message appears:
+
image:TwitterDeploySuccess.png[TwitterDeploySuccess]


=== Watch the CloudHub Logs

It can take several minutes for your application to upload and deploy. This process can be monitored through the CloudHub dashboard. Since your application includes Logger components, the Runtime Manager console also shows you the log entries these components generate.

. Go back to the Runtime Manager Console.
. Choose the environment by clicking Production:
+
image:TwitterChooseEnvironment.png[TwitterChooseEnvironment]
+
. Hover your mouse over the application name, and click *Logs*:
+
image:TwitterLogsMenu.png[TwitterLogsMenu]
+
. After deployment completes, you should see a system message that the application was started.
+
image:TwitterLogListing.png[TwitterLogListing]

== Step 7: Run the Project

You are now ready to run the project! First, you need to determine the URL where it is running, and then add your Tweet as a query parameter to the URL.

As an example, if you deployed your application to _twittertutorial_ and you would like to Tweet "I built a new CloudHub application", the URL would be:

[source, code, linenums]
----
http://twittertutorial.cloudhub.io/sendtweet?tweet=I built a new CloudHub application
----

Note that for some browsers, you may need to replace spaces in the URL with "%20". In this case, enter the URL as follows:

[source,bash, linenums]
----
http://twittertesttest.cloudhub.io/sendtweet?tweet=I%20built%20a%20new%20Mule%20CloudHub%20application
----

How did we arrive at this URL? Much of it is configured while building the project:

* The sub-domain, *twittertesttest* (as an example), was entered as the "domain" when deploying the project from Anypoint Studio. This was an option you entered in the Deploy to CloudHub dialog when you deployed your application. Note that it must be unique across all CloudHub deployments.
* */sendtweet* was defined as the *Path* in the HTTP Endpoint.
* We configured the Twitter Connector with an expression:
+
`#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.tweet]`
+
This expression passes the value of a query parameter ("tweet") in the URL string to your Twitter user stream.

Now log into your Twitter account, you should see your new Tweet posted. If you try this again, be sure to change the Tweet contents, as Twitter bounces duplicate posts. The web page should also show a response: *Thanks for Tweeting!*

The Runtime Manager console  also shows various results from the logger components. These are discussed in the next section.

== How the Project Works

In this section, we take an inside look at messages within the flow, and see how expressions allow us to control which data is sent to Twitter. We also revisit with the Logger component and view the output they produce in the Runtime Manager console.

=== About the Payload

The flow we built in Mule Studio contains message processors –- including the HTTP Endpoint, Twitter Connector and Expression Transformer — and it is “Mule messages” that carry data between these message processors.

A Mule message contains the following components:

* Payload – this is the actual data that we are concerned with in this application
* Properties—Along with a set of standard parameters, user defined parameters may be included as well. We access an “inbound property” in this application to view the URL query parameter.
* Attachments—Although not used in this project, other applications may include attachments such as an XML file or PDF attachment.

=== About Mule Expression Language

Messages within the Mule flow can be quite complex, and it is often necessary to perform some operation on them, or extract pertinent information. In this project, we needed to extract a URL query parameter from the properties component of the message, and send it to the Twitter user stream. We used Mule Expression Language to do so.

CloudHub supports many expression languages, including Groovy, xpath, regex and more. However, the syntax of these languages vary from one to another, and to allow for a common and easy-to-use syntax specifically for operating on Mule messages, Mule Expression Language was recently introduced.

Mule Expression Language provides a powerful and comprehensive set of features. In this project, we used expressions at several points in the flow:

* The Twitter Connector used the following Mule expression to pass the URL query parameter, "tweet" to the Twitter user stream:
+
`#[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.tweet]`

* The Expression Transformer used the following Mule expression to extract the returned text, or Tweet, from the payload produced by Twitter:
+
`"Thanks for Tweeting! Your message: " + #[message.payload.text]`

* The logger component extracted the payload generated by Twitter:
+
`#[payload]`

=== View Logs in the Runtime Manager console

Now with an understanding of Mule messages and expressions, let's take a look at the log entries produced by the Logger components. First, produce a new Tweet by visiting a URL such as this (be sure to change "twittertutorial" to your unique sub-domain):

http://twittertutorial.cloudhub.io/sendtweet?tweet=Sent from my CloudHub application

Now log into the Runtime Manager console, select this application, and go to the "logs" tab (as detailed above). After you visited the URL above, you should see a new set of log entries.

The first log entry was produced by the expression we configured in the Logger component:

`Tweet: #[message.inboundProperties.'http.query.params'.tweet]`

It produced this result in the Runtime Manager console:

[source,bash, linenums]
----
Tweet: Sent from my CloudHub application
----

Note that we added the text "Tweet" to precede the results of the Mule expression; this is so that we could more easily identify this message in the log console.

For the second Logger component, we used this expression:

`#[payload]`

This produced a much longer log result in the Runtime Manager console:

[source,json, linenums]
----
StatusJSONImpl{createdAt=Mon Jun 04 23:03:00 UTC 2012, id=209782335479174657,
text='Sent from my CloudHub application', source='CloudHub integration', isTruncated=false,
inReplyToStatusId=-1, inReplyToUserId=-1, isFavorited=false, inReplyToScreenName='null',
geoLocation=null, place=null, retweetCount=0, wasRetweetedByMe=false, contributors=null,
annotations=null, retweetedStatus=null, userMentionEntities=null, urlEntities=null, hashtagEntities=null, user=UserJSONImpl{id=563265508, name='MuleIONtest',
screenName='MuleCloudHubtest384', location='null', description='null', isContributorsEnabled=false,
...
----

This second Logger component shows us that the Twitter Connector produced a payload that is the API response from Twitter. This response includes the string we Tweeted, as well as the user name and other data about the user account associated with the user stream we accessed.

Instead of logging the complete payload, you could log just the tweet by using the expression:

`#[payload.text]`

You could also log a more complex expression, such as the user screen name which is further nested in the payload:

`#[payload.user.ScreenName]`
