= Managing CloudHub Specific Settings
:keywords: anypoint platform, permissions, configuring, cloudhub

This document describes Anypoint Platforms settings for CloudHub.

== Managing Regions

_Admin Only_

If Global Deployment is enabled on your account, you can also set the *Default Region*. The region auto-populates in the deployment screen settings for all applications deployed by users in your organization, and it can be adjusted at the application level if necessary for individual deployments. Access this menu by clicking the gear icon next to your user name at the top of the screen and then picking the *General* link, under CLOUDHUB in the left menu.

[NOTE]
If you don't currently have Global Deployment enabled on your account but would like it, you can file a ticket in the link:/anypoint-platform-administration/community-and-support[support portal].

== Managing Environments

_Admin Only_

CloudHub gives you the ability to create separate environments for deploying, these are independent from each other. Environments can either be of *production* or *sandbox* type. By default, when creating a new organization you get one production environment named *Production*.

Sandbox environments are helpfully restrictive environments for developers and testers, they facilitate safe testing of applications without the risk of affecting the production environment.

For example, you can create a sandbox environment for a QA team in which they can test new releases of applications before deploying in production. You can add users to a sandbox environment without permitting them to access the production environment, thereby securing production and eliminating the risk of a developer accidentally operating upon an application in production. After you are sure an application is safe to expose to users, you can easily promote the application from a sandbox environment to a production environment.

To create or manage environments, access the corresponding menu by clicking the gear icon at the top of the screen and clicking *Environments*:

To add an environment, click *Add environment*. Add a name, click *Production* or *Sandbox*, and click *Create*:

To rename or delete an environment, click its entry in the table.

In the *Edit environment* menu:

* *Update*: Change the name and click *Update*. 
* *Delete*: To delete an environment, click *Delete*.

You can't grant users access to an environment directly, you must do it through the use of roles. To grant a role permissions to access your new environment, see link:/anypoint-platform-administration/managing-accounts-roles-and-permissions[Managing Accounts Roles and Permissions].

[WARNING]
Depending on the type of subscription you have on CloudHub, you may be restricted to creating a limited amount of each kind of environment.

For more on managing environments see link:/anypoint-platform-administration/managing-cloudhub-environments[Managing CloudHub Environments].

== CloudHub Subscription

[NOTE]
*The Number of Workers Is Not the Same as the Number of Applications* +

Note that there is not a 1:1 relationship between workers and applications. For more information on Worker Sizing, see link:/runtime-manager/cloudhub-fabric[CloudHub Fabric] and link:/runtime-manager/deploying-a-cloudhub-application[Deploying a CloudHub Application].

== Changing Your Plan

To change your plan, you can contact your account representative or file a support ticket.
